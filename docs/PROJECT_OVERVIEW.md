# Rai Guest House WebApp â€“ Project Overview

## Vision

The Rai Guest House Management System is designed to:

- Provide a seamless digital experience for guests to order food, explore tourism information, and interact with the guest house services
- Equip administrators with a Progressive Web App (PWA) for real-time order notifications, offline capabilities, and full management control from mobile devices
- Operate across any platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, cloud providers) without reliance on Replit or platform-specific features
- Integrate with Google Sheets for order tracking and historical data

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript
- **Database**: In-memory by default, with optional PostgreSQL support
- **Admin Interface**: PWA with service worker, notifications, and mobile-first design
- **Communication**: Real-time updates via WebSockets
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI
- **Build Tool**: Vite (portable configuration without Replit plugins)

## Key Features

- Guest ordering system
- Tourism info with photos and maps
- Admin panel with real-time order management
- Mobile-ready, offline-supporting PWA
- Theme customization with light/dark/system appearance
- Error handling with modals and debugging tools
- Google Sheets integration for orders
- Portable setup for deployment on any platform
- WebSocket reconnection handling and stability fixes

## What Was Removed

The system was initially built with Replit-specific dependencies. These have been removed:

- Replit-specific Vite plugins for theming and error handling
- Replit Cartographer (source mapping tool)

## What Was Added or Changed

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Custom Theme Handler | Fully portable and React-based with system preference detection |
| Error Handler | Modal-based UI for runtime and unhandled promise errors |
| WebSocket Handler | Centralized context, connection backoff, cleanup, and message management |
| `.env` Management | Unified setup for local and production use |
| Deployment | Supports traditional Node hosting, Docker, Render, Railway, and Netlify |
| Database | Optional PostgreSQL support with Drizzle ORM |
| Startup Scripts | Platform-specific scripts for Linux/macOS and Windows |
| Portable Configuration | Script and guide for converting Replit projects to universal setup |
