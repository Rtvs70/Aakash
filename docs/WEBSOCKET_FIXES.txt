# WebSocket Connection Issue Fixes

## Problem Overview
The application was experiencing rapid WebSocket connection/disconnection cycles, causing performance issues and potential memory leaks. This was happening because:
1. Multiple components were creating their own WebSocket connections
2. There was no proper reconnection strategy with backoff
3. Dead connections weren't being properly detected and cleaned up
4. Error handling was insufficient

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Centralized WebSocket Management
- Created a new `WebSocketContext` provider that serves as a single source of truth for WebSocket connections
- Implemented a global flag to prevent multiple connection attempts from different components
- Added the provider to the root App component to ensure it's available throughout the application

### 2. Connection Rate Limiting
- Added timestamp tracking for connection attempts
- Implemented a minimum delay between connection attempts (2-3 seconds)
- Added logging to track connection lifecycle for debugging

### 3. Exponential Backoff for Reconnection
- Implemented progressive delays between reconnection attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...
- Added a maximum delay cap of 30 seconds to prevent excessive waiting
- Reset reconnection counter on successful connections

### 4. Enhanced Server-side Connection Management
- Added proper ping/pong mechanism to detect dead connections
- Implemented connection tracking with proper timeouts
- Added graceful connection termination for problematic connections
- Enhanced error handling with proper cleanup

### 5. Improved Connection Lifecycle Management
- Added proper cleanup of event handlers on component unmount
- Implemented visibility change detection to reconnect when browser tab becomes active
- Added connection state tracking with proper updates

### 6. Custom Event System
- Implemented a DOM-based event system for WebSocket messages
- Allows components to listen for specific events without connecting directly
- Reduces coupling between components and WebSocket implementation

### 7. Safer Message Broadcasting
- Added robust error handling for message broadcasts
- Created a safe broadcast function that handles errors gracefully
- Added connection state verification before sending messages

## Technical Implementation Details

### Client-side Changes
- Created `use-websocket-context.tsx` with React Context API
- Updated `App.tsx` to use the WebSocket provider at the root level
- Updated `admin.tsx` to use the context and listen for custom events
- Added internal flags to prevent reconnection loops

### Server-side Changes
- Enhanced WebSocket server initialization in `routes.ts` with better options
- Added compression for efficient message transfer
- Implemented server-side ping/pong mechanism
- Added proper error handling for client connections

## Results
- Stable WebSocket connections without rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- Better error recovery with exponential backoff
- Reduced network traffic and server load
- More consistent real-time updates
- Improved user experience with reliable notifications
